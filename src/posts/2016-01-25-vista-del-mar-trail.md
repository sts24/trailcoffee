Look anywhere in the hills of the Conejo Valley and there is probably a hiking trail hidden away above the suburban landscape. <a href="http://cosf.org/dos-vientos/">Vista Del Mar Trail in Newbury Park, Ca</a> is one of those many easily accessible trails of the renown open space of the Conejo Valley.

This trail will lead you up and away from the local neighborhood meander around the chaparral covered hill sides. About a mile in, there is a option to turn right and head up towards the large power lines with a great view of Camarillo, Oxnard, and all the way to Ventura on a clear day. Return the same way, but continue on your way toward the Twin Ponds. These scenic little ponds are closed off to swimming, but act as a refuge to animals that frequent the area. Continue past the ponds and head up hill to a view of the Pacific Ocean. If you are lucky on a clear day, a great view of Anacapa Island and the Santa Barbara Channel.

Vista Del Mar may not be the most challenging hike, but sometimes it is nice to have a quick and simple trail available to locals needing some outdoor time.
