Sitting atop a coastal bluff overlooking PCH and the Pacific Ocean, <a href="http://www.lamountains.com/parks.asp?parkid=95">Charmlee is a small regional park operated by the City of Malibu</a>. The rolling hills and patches of oak woodland of the Santa Monica Mountains make the park ideal for beginning hikers looking to wander around without getting too far off the beaten path. The views extend from the surrounding mountains, Catalina Island to the south, the Channel Islands to the west, and even far into the Los Angeles basin on a clear day to the east. The park is easily accessible from Encinal Canyon Road off Highway 1 and costs just a few dollars to park your car.
