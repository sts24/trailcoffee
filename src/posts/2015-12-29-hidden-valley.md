One of the best things about <a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm">Joshua Tree National Park</a> is the variety of hiking trails it offers. There are opportunities for hikers of all comfort levels in the park from short nature walks to multi-day backcountry treks. It is an easily accessible National Park in Southern California and one does not even need to tackle a strenuous hike to enjoy the desert wilderness of Joshua Tree. <a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/planyourvisit/upload/HiddenValley.pdf">Hidden Valley</a> is a very simple and flat hike around a one-mile loop in the northern portion of the park. This loop gives a taste of the variety of ecology of this area and is a favorite starting point for many rock climbers who are seeking more vertical adventures.
