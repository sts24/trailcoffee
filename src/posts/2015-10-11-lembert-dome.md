The high country the rocky granite ridge lined meadow of Tuolumne is one of the most beautiful places in Yosemite National Park. It is easily accessible by Highway 150 from Yosemite Valley from the south or Tioga Pass in the east. While driving on the Tioga Road through the meadow, you will come across what is probably the most prominent granite dome in the area, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tmhikes.htm">this is Lembert Dome</a>. The base of the dome offers parking for picnickers, hikers, and rock climbers who take on the sheer vertical side to the top. However, for those of us who fair better on more horizontal terrain, there is a fairly easy hiking trail that meanders around the eastern side of Lembert Dome to the top. The roughly 3 mile round trip offers sweeping views of the Tuolumne Meadows as well as the beautiful and rugged high Sierras.
