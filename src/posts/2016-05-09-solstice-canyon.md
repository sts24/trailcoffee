When we talk about the popular hikes in the Los Angeles area, thereâ€™s a good chance you are going to see Solstice Canyon on that list. This canyon sits right off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu and thus makes it very accessible from the LA area. Because of this, it is a very popular hike that can get crowded quickly. Plan to either arrive early or park further up the road and walk toward the trailhead.

There are a variety of trails in the area to choose from. The trail in the bottom of the canyon follows along a riparian woodland and takes you to the ruins of the Roberts Ranch House. Here, you can explore an old house and make your way to the nearby waterfall. The amount of water will vary during the year, as it was just a trickle on my visit in late April.

This would be a fulfilling enough of a hike at this point, but from here you can venture further up the canyon to the Rising Sun Trail. This step section will take you up to the top of the ridge where you will be treated to views of the ocean and a better vantage point of the ruins.
