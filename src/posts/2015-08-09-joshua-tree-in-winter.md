<a href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/">This famous National Park</a> is located just north of Palm Springs, Ca right on the dividing line of the Mojave and Colorado deserts. The high desert section of the Mojave sits at just high enough elevation to occasionally allow for snow. The Joshua tree, of the parkâ€™s namesake, is such a strong symbol of the vast southwest American desert that seeing fields of them covered in snow makes for such a striking landscape. If you are able to get out to this park right after a storm in Winter months, it is very worth taking the trip. The park is easily drivable for a day trip, but there are several easy hikes such as Hidden Valley and Barker Dam.
