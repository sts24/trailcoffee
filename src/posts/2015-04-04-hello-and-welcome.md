It has been a long time goal of mine to launch a website project that would be an outlet of some of my interests. This has been an ongoing thing for many years with many attempts and degrees of longevity. What I have found is that working full time with one and a half jobs, the last thing on my mind is to keep sitting at a computer for another side project. However, there has always been that desire to create something that is completely my own and not built to some one else’s design specs. I think this might be it.

Another thing that has always held me back is finding a topic to focus on. Ideas in the past took many forms ranging from technology, art, design, cars, auto racing, etc. Most never really got out of the weekend daydreaming phase. While those are all things I think about a lot, I never felt that I could really speak from any place of authority where I could contribute something new to the greater conversation of those topics.

Which leads me to this new site. I spend a lot of time hiking on the weekends, and when the schedule allows, longer overnight camping trips. My friends and family frequently ask me if I have been hiking anywhere interesting recently and the answer is usually yes. This will be a project for me to share my photos and notes about the place I have been. While there are many other great outdoors sites focused around Southern California, like <a href="http://www.modernhiker.com">Modern Hiker</a>, <a href="http://100peaks.com">100 Peaks</a>, <a href="http://nobodyhikesinla.com">Nobody Hikes in LA</a>, etc, I think I will have a different take on the presentation.

Welcome!
<h2>P.S. – Why Trail Coffee?</h2>
I wanted to build a site that wasn’t directly featuring my name and myself. I also wanted the name to not really mean anything, in case it wanders away from the original premise. Trail Coffee is just something I landed on one evening.
