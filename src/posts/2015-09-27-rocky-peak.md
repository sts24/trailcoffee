Rocky Peak is nestled in the hills of the Santa Susana Pass in the far eastern end of Simi Valley. The trailhead is immediately at the top of the pass right off the 101 freeway, but the hike will quickly lead you away from the bustling noise of the road. The trail steadily rises upwards, meandering around large formations and the chaparral scrub that the area is covered in. The top of the ridge will give you great views of the Santa Monica Mountains to the south, Simi Valley to the west, and the San Fernando Valley to the east.
